# This is the password that will be used for HMAC
Given I have a 'string' named 'theBackendPassword'

# Loading the data that the user is entering at the signup. This data will be sent from the client to the server
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'userData'

# The server creates a HMAC of the 'userData'
When I create the HMAC of 'userData' with key 'theBackendPassword'
When I rename the 'HMAC' to 'seedServerSideShard.HMAC'

# Here we print the HMAC
Then print the 'seedServerSideShard.HMAC'
